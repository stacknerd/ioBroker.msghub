    "md": "### What it does\n\n- Creates and maintains one Message Hub message (`kind: shoppinglist`) representing your Alexa list.\n- Keeps changes in sync:\n  - Alexa → Message Hub (ingest)\n  - Message Hub → Alexa (write-back)\n- Optional: assigns a `category` to list items using Message Hub AI (when enabled).\n\nWhat it intentionally does not do (today):\n\n- It does not aggregate duplicates like “Butter” + “Butter” into a single item with a quantity.\n- It does not parse quantities/units from item text (e.g. “2x”, “500g”).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- `iobroker.alexa2` must be installed and running.\n- You need an Alexa list state that contains the list as a JSON array, typically:\n  - `alexa2.0.Lists.<LISTNAME>.json`\n- For write-back, your `alexa2` installation must expose the command states derived from that list id (see below).\n\nIf you want AI categories:\n\n- The Message Hub adapter must have AI enabled in its instance config (provider + API key).\n- The plugin option `aiEnhancement` must be enabled.\n\n### Quick start (recommended setup)\n\n1. Make sure the Alexa list JSON state exists and contains an array (in ioBroker Admin → Objects).\n2. Create one `BridgeAlexaShopping` instance in the Message Hub Plugins tab.\n3. Set:\n   - `jsonStateId` to your Alexa list JSON state\n   - `listTitle` to a human-friendly name\n   - `fullSyncIntervalMs` to something reasonable (example: `3600000` = 1 hour)\n4. Enable the plugin instance (`...enable` switch).\n5. Watch the resulting Message Hub message:\n   - Items from Alexa should appear as `listItems`.\n6. Test write-back:\n   - Add an item in the Message Hub list → it should appear in Alexa after the next sync.\n\n### How to configure\n\nConfiguration is done in the Message Hub Admin Tab (Plugins) and uses the schema from `lib/BridgeAlexaShopping/manifest.js`.\n\nRequired / common options:\n\n- `jsonStateId` (string)\n  - The Alexa list JSON state (example: `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.json`).\n  - This single option also determines the write-back command ids (derived from `jsonStateId` without the `.json` suffix).\n- `listTitle` (string)\n  - The Message Hub message title.\n- `location` (string)\n  - Written to `details.location` of the message.\n- `audienceTagsCsv` (string, CSV)\n  - Inbound (Alexa → MsgHub): comma-separated tags copied to `audience.tags`.\n- `audienceChannelsIncludeCsv` / `audienceChannelsExcludeCsv` (string, CSV)\n  - Inbound (Alexa → MsgHub): copied to `audience.channels.include` / `audience.channels.exclude`.\n- `fullSyncIntervalMs` (number)\n  - Periodic full reconciliation interval; `0` disables the periodic run.\n- `conflictWindowMs` (number)\n  - Conflict debounce window after write-back (see best practices below).\n- `keepCompleted` (number, ms)\n  - Retention time for completed items.\n  - After this duration, completed items are deleted (in Message Hub and therefore also in Alexa).\n  - Use `0` to never delete completed items.\n\nAI options:\n\n- `aiEnhancement` (boolean)\n  - Enables optional AI enrichment (category assignment).\n- `categoriesCsv` (string, CSV)\n  - The list of allowed categories.\n  - The last entry is treated as the fallback category.\n- `aiMinConfidencePct` (number)\n  - Minimum confidence (0..100) for accepting an AI category.\n  - When below this threshold, the fallback category is used.\n\n### How to find the correct `jsonStateId`\n\nIn ioBroker Admin:\n\n- Open the Objects tab.\n- Search for `alexa2.0.Lists.` and look for states ending in `.json`.\n- Pick the list you want to sync (example: `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.json`).\n\nThe value must be a JSON array of items with (at least) `id`, `value`, and `completed` fields. If it is not an array,\nthe plugin treats it as empty.\n\n### Write-back (how Alexa commands are addressed)\n\nWrite-back uses `setForeignState(...)` to these ids (derived from `jsonStateId`):\n\nLet `base = jsonStateId` without the trailing `.json`.\n\n- Create: `base.#New` or `base.#create` (value = item text; the plugin auto-detects which command state exists)\n- Rename: `base.items.<itemId>.value` (value = new text)\n- Toggle completion: `base.items.<itemId>.completed` (value = `true|false`)\n- Delete: `base.items.<itemId>.#delete` (value = `true`)\n\nExample for `jsonStateId = alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.json`:\n\n- `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.#New` (or `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.#create`)\n- `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.items.<itemId>.value`\n- `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.items.<itemId>.completed`\n- `alexa2.0.Lists.SHOP.items.<itemId>.#delete`\n\n### How to verify write-back is working\n\nUse ioBroker Admin → Objects:\n\n- Check that the derived command states exist under the same list base (without `.json`).\n- When you add or change an item in Message Hub, you should see writes to:\n  - `...#New` (or `...#create`) for new items\n  - `...items.<id>.value` for renames\n  - `...items.<id>.completed` for check/uncheck\n  - `...items.<id>.#delete` for deletions\n\nIf these command states do not exist in your `alexa2` installation, Message Hub can still read the list, but cannot\nwrite back to Alexa.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- Prefer one plugin instance per Alexa list.\n- Keep `jsonStateId` stable. Changing it changes the message `ref` and resets the mapping for that instance.\n- Use `fullSyncIntervalMs` even when state-change events are working:\n  - It acts as a periodic reconciliation and helps recover from missed events or temporary connectivity issues.\n- Keep completed-item cleanup explicit:\n  - Use `keepCompleted=0` to keep completed items forever.\n  - Use a finite value (example: `12 * 60 * 60 * 1000`) to automatically delete completed items after that time.\n  - Deletion is enforced during reconciliation (`fullSyncIntervalMs`) and on inbound list updates.\n- Avoid manual edits to internal states:\n  - `msghub.0.BridgeAlexaShopping.<instanceId>.mapping`\n  - `msghub.0.BridgeAlexaShopping.<instanceId>.categories`\n  These states are intentionally marked read-only (for users); the adapter still writes to them internally.\n- Conflicts and loops:\n  - If you have other automations writing to the same Alexa list, keep `conflictWindowMs` at a non-zero value (default `5000`).\n  - This reduces “ping-pong” updates by enforcing Message Hub as the source of truth after write-back.\n- AI categories:\n  - If `aiEnhancement` is enabled in the plugin but AI is disabled in the adapter instance config, category assignment is skipped (no errors; it just does nothing).\n  - Keep `categoriesCsv` small and stable. Changing the list resets the learned cache for that plugin instance.\n  - Pick categories that match how you actually shop. Example set:\n    - `Produce,Bakery,Dairy,Meat,Frozen,Pantry,Drinks,Household,Hygiene,Other`\n\n### Operational notes\n\n- Disable behavior:\n  - When you disable the plugin instance, the Message Hub message is kept.\n  - The title is updated with a “connection lost” suffix (to make the inactive state visible).\n- Managed state reporting:\n  - The plugin reports the monitored `jsonStateId` as a managed state (metadata stamping + watchlist) so you can see\n    which external state is used by this plugin instance.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nCommon symptoms and what to check:\n\n- “Nothing appears in Message Hub”\n  - Verify `jsonStateId` exists and contains a JSON array.\n  - Check whether the plugin instance is enabled and running.\n  - Trigger a manual change in the Alexa list and confirm the `.json` state updates.\n\n- “Items appear in Message Hub but do not write back to Alexa”\n  - Verify the derived command states exist (see “Write-back” section).\n  - Check adapter logs for warnings about `setForeignState` failures.\n\n- “Items oscillate / ping-pong between values”\n  - Increase `conflictWindowMs` (start with the default `5000`).\n  - Reduce other automations that write to the same list, or ensure they do not fight Message Hub.\n\n- “AI categories do not show up”\n  - Confirm AI is enabled in the Message Hub adapter instance config and a valid API key is set.\n  - Confirm `aiEnhancement=true` and `categoriesCsv` is not empty in the plugin instance config.\n  - Note: AI categorization is best-effort; if AI is unavailable, syncing still works (without categories).\n\n---",

In **Message**, decide how the message should look and behave (title/text/audience/reminders/auto-remove…).\n\n### Choosing the right rule type (quick decision help)\n\n- If the problem is “too high/too low / outside a range / wrong boolean”: use **Threshold**.\n- If the problem is “sensor does not report anymore”: use **Freshness**.\n- If the problem is “when A is active, B must react within time X”: use **Dependency (Trigger)**.\n- If the problem is “value never calms down / keeps trending for too long”: use **Non-settling**.\n- If you want “started / ended” behavior: use **Session**.\n\n### Messages: “store truth” vs “notifications”\n\nMsgHub keeps a message in its store (so you can see the problem state), and it can also notify you.\nThese are related but not identical:\n\n- A message can be **open** in the store without constantly notifying you (e.g. snoozed, cooldown, reminders off).\n- A message can update silently (metrics updates) without producing notification noise.\n\n### Actions (buttons) you can use\n\nActions are defined by the rule (not by a per-object “actions” setting):\n\n- **Ack**: “I saw it.” The message stays as-is; IngestStates does not “re-open” it just because the condition is still true.\n- **Snooze (4h)**: suppresses notifications for 4 hours (the message can still be updated silently).\n- **Close**: offered automatically when auto-remove is disabled, so you can always get rid of a message.\n- **Delete**: used only for the *session start* message (so you can permanently dismiss it during the running session).\n\n### Shared “Message” settings (what they mean)\n\nThese settings apply to all rule types:\n\n- **Kind / Level**\n  - Kind: usually “status” (a condition) or “task” (something to do).\n  - Level: notice / warning / error (how important is it).\n- **Task planning (only for Kind = “task”)**\n  - **Estimated time**: stores an estimate for how long the task will take.\n  - **Due in**: sets a due date relative to “now” when the message is created.\n- **Title / Text (optional)**\n  - If you leave them empty, the rule provides a helpful default text.\n  - If you provide your own text, it is used as-is.\n- **Audience (optional)**\n  - Tags and Channels are comma-separated lists (CSV). Use this to send different messages to different integrations/users.\n- **Reminder**\n  - Optional repeated notifications while the issue stays active.\n  - Use this for “still broken” reminders, not for high-frequency telemetry.\n- **Back to normal**\n  - “Auto-remove message(s)” closes the message automatically when the condition becomes normal again.\n  - Optional “Delay” helps against flapping (briefly normal → briefly bad → normal…).\n- **Cooldown**\n  - After a message was closed, cooldown prevents “close → instant reopen → notify again” spam.\n  - Important: cooldown does not “hide valid warnings” in the store. If the condition returns during cooldown, MsgHub keeps the store truthful and delays/avoids the next notification.\n\nPractical recommendation (good defaults to start with):\n\n- Keep **Auto-remove** enabled for most rules.\n- Use a small **Delay** (e.g. 1–5 minutes) if your source flaps.\n- Use **Cooldown** if you see a lot of “close → reopen” noise.\n\n### Location (room) auto-detection\n\nIf your datapoint is assigned to an ioBroker room (`enum.rooms.*`), IngestStates stores the room name as\n`Location` in the message details. This can help notification integrations and UI grouping.\n\n### Writing your own text (optional, advanced)\n\nSome rule defaults (and your own texts) can include placeholders like:\n\n- `{{m.state-value}}` (current value)\n- `{{m.lastSeenAt|datetime}}` (timestamp as date/time)\n- `{{m.lastSeenAt|durationSince}}` (“how long ago”)\n\nFormatting note for `durationSince` / `durationUntil`:\n\n- `< 1min`: `56s`\n- `< 1h`: `34m` (rounded)\n- `< 1 day`: `3:45h` (rounded)\n- `>= 1 day`: `1d 4h` (rounded)\n\nTip: start with defaults. Only customize title/text once the rule behavior is correct.\n\n---\n\n## 1.1 Rule types (explained with examples)\n\n### Threshold (value outside a limit/range)\n\nUse Threshold when “the value should be inside a limit/range, otherwise alert”.\n\nTypical use cases:\n\n- Battery below 10%\n- Humidity outside 35–60%\n- Window contact is TRUE for too long (boolean)\n\nHow it behaves:\n\n- When the value enters the “bad” area, a message appears (immediately or after an optional minimum duration).\n- While active, the message stores the latest value as a metric.\n- When the value returns to normal, the message is closed automatically (if enabled) or stays until you close it.\n\nOptions you will see in the Threshold tab:\n\n- **Condition type**\n  - “Too low / Too high” (single limit)\n  - “Outside / Inside range” (two limits)\n  - “Boolean TRUE/FALSE” (useful for contacts, switches, errors)\n- **Hysteresis**\n  - Adds a “buffer zone” to avoid flapping around the boundary.\n  - Example (too high): alert above 50, but clear only when value goes below 48.\n- **Minimum duration**\n  - “Condition must stay bad for X before creating the message.”\n  - This avoids short spikes.\n\nWhat “back to normal” means here:\n\n- For numeric limits/ranges, the value must cross the “safe side” again (with hysteresis, the safe side is slightly wider).\n- For boolean conditions, it must become the opposite value (TRUE → FALSE, or FALSE → TRUE).\n\nHow to tune it (common patterns):\n\n- **Flapping around a boundary** → increase hysteresis, or add a reset delay (Message tab).\n- **Short spikes** → use minimum duration.\n- **You want a human-friendly message** → start with defaults, then adjust title/text once you like the behavior.\n\nPractical examples:\n\n- Humidity outside 35–60%, hysteresis 2%: the message clears only once it is clearly back inside.\n- Power above 500W for at least 5 minutes: avoids “short kettle spike” alerts.\n\n### Freshness (no update / no change for too long)\n\nUse Freshness when the datapoint should be “alive”, and missing updates likely mean “sensor offline” or “adapter stuck”.\n\nTwo variants:\n\n- **No update**: alert if the datapoint did not receive any update for X.\n- **No value change**: alert if the *value* did not change for X (useful when devices only report on change).\n\nHow to choose between “update” and “change”:\n\n- If the device sends keepalives (updates even when the value stays the same) → use **No update**.\n- If the device only sends values when they change → use **No value change**.\n- If you are unsure: look at the datapoint’s “last update” vs “last change” timestamps in ioBroker.\n\nHow it behaves:\n\n- IngestStates tracks the last update/change timestamp.\n- When the “age” exceeds your configured threshold, a message is opened.\n- When a new update/change arrives, the message is closed (if configured).\n\nImportant note:\n\n- Freshness needs periodic evaluation. If the plugin’s global “Evaluate interval” is set to `0` (event-only),\n  Freshness will not create alerts because it has no tick to compare “now vs last update”.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Temperature sensor: “at least one update every 12 hours”\n- Heartbeat / keepalive: “at least once every 5 minutes”\n\n### Dependency (Trigger): “When A happens, B must react”\n\nUse this rule when one datapoint acts as a “trigger”, and another datapoint must react within a time window.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Valve turns ON → water meter must increase within 10 minutes\n- Plug turns ON → power must become >= 5W within 30 seconds\n- Heating turns ON → flow temperature must rise by at least 2°C within 15 minutes\n\nHow it behaves:\n\n- The window starts **only when the trigger becomes active** (rising edge).\n- If the trigger becomes inactive before the window ends, the timer is cancelled and no message is created.\n- If the window ends and the expectation is not met, a message is opened.\n- If the expectation becomes true later, the message closes via your normal “Back to normal” settings.\n\nHow to configure it (in simple terms):\n\n- Pick the **trigger datapoint** (the one that “starts the window”).\n- Decide what “trigger is active” means:\n  - simplest: “trigger is truthy” (on/off, motion, enable flags)\n  - advanced: “trigger equals X / greater than X / less than X”\n- Choose the **time window** (how long you give the system to react).\n- Choose the **expected reaction** of the monitored datapoint:\n  - “it changed” (value change)\n  - “it increased/decreased by at least …”\n  - “it reached at least / at most …”\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n\n- If you choose “greater/less than”, the trigger value must be numeric (strings like `\"12\"` still work; non-numeric does not).\n- Choose a window that matches real-world latency (slow devices and adapter schedules can easily need minutes).\n\nExample (valve → meter):\n\n- Trigger datapoint: `valveState`\n- Trigger active: “truthy”\n- Window: `10 minutes`\n- Expectation: “increased by at least 1” (delta up)\n\nIf the valve turns on, but the meter does not move within 10 minutes, you get a message.\nWhen the meter finally moves, the message can close automatically (if auto-remove is enabled).\n\n### Non-settling value (never stable / unexpected trend)\n\nUse this when the problem is not “too high/low”, but “the value behaves oddly for a long time”.\n\nThere are two profiles:\n\n#### Profile “Activity” (never becomes stable)\n\nUse when the value keeps moving/fluctuating and never reaches a stable phase.\n\nYou control:\n\n- What counts as a relevant change (minimum delta)\n- How long continuous activity is tolerated (max continuous)\n- How long it must stay “quiet” to be considered stable (quiet gap)\n\nThe message is opened when the value has been continuously “not stable” for longer than the max duration.\nThe message is cleared when the value becomes stable again (quiet phase long enough).\n\nExample (activity):\n\n- Datapoint: `humidity`\n- Minimum delta: `1` (ignore tiny noise)\n- Quiet gap: `10 min` (must be calm for 10 min to count as stable)\n- Max continuous: `6 h` (alert if it never calms down for 6 hours)\n\nHow to tune:\n\n- If you get alerts too early → increase max continuous.\n- If it never clears even though it looks stable → increase quiet gap or increase minimum delta (noise).\n\n#### Profile “Trend” (keeps rising or falling)\n\nUse when the value keeps moving in one direction for too long.\n\nYou control:\n\n- Direction (up / down / any)\n- How long the trend must persist (trend window)\n- How much total movement must happen before it counts (minimum total delta)\n\nTip:\n\n- If “no more updates” should be treated as a problem, combine this rule with **Freshness** (they solve different problems).\n\nExample (trend):\n\n- Datapoint: `waterMeter`\n- Direction: `up`\n- Trend window: `30 min`\n- Minimum delta: `0.1` (ignore tiny counter wobble)\n- Minimum total delta: `5` (alert only if there was meaningful movement)\n\nImportant note:\n\n- This rule clears based on new incoming values (a “broken trend”), not based on silence. If the device stops reporting,\n  the rule does not treat that as “back to normal” (use Freshness for missing updates).\n\n### Session (Start/Stop): “Detect a run and summarize”\n\nUse Session when you want a start/end message for a process that can be detected from a “power” datapoint.\n\nTypical examples:\n\n- Washing machine / dishwasher cycle\n- Pump run\n- Heating cycle (with a power threshold)\n\nHow it behaves:\n\n- Start: power rises above the start threshold (optionally must stay above it for a minimum hold time).\n- End: power falls below the stop threshold (optionally must stay below it for a stop delay).\n- Optional gate: a separate on/off datapoint can enable/disable monitoring; switching the gate off ends a running session.\n- Optional counter + price datapoints can be used to calculate session consumption/cost metrics.\n\nOptions you will see in the Session tab:\n\n- **Gate (optional)**\n  - Lets you “enable/disable” monitoring from another datapoint (e.g. a mode switch).\n  - If the gate turns off during a running session, the session ends.\n- **Start threshold + start hold (optional)**\n  - The value must rise above the threshold to be considered “started”.\n  - Start hold requires it to stay above the threshold for a minimum time (debounce).\n- **Stop threshold + stop delay (optional)**\n  - The value must fall below the threshold to be considered “ended”.\n  - Stop delay requires it to stay below the threshold for a minimum time (debounce).\n- **Cancel stop when value rises again**\n  - Prevents false “end” detections when the value briefly dips below the stop threshold.\n- **Energy counter + price (optional)**\n  - Lets MsgHub compute “consumed” and “cost” metrics for the end message.\n  - Units are taken from the datapoints themselves (could be anything, not just kWh / €).\n\nMessages:\n\n- End message: always created on session end.\n- Optional start message: can be created when the session begins.\n  - When the end message is created, the start message is soft-deleted (removed), not closed.\n  - When a new session starts, the previous end message is closed (cause eliminated) so it does not stay around forever.\n\nWhere to configure the start message:\n\n- In the **Message** tab, enable “Create start message” and fill out the separate start-message fields (title/text/audience/etc.).\n\nExample (washing machine):\n\n- Power datapoint: starts above `10 W`, ends below `3 W`\n- Start hold: `1 min` (avoid short bumps)\n- Stop delay: `10 min` (avoid “pause” ending the session)\n- Optional counter datapoint: energy meter\n- Optional price datapoint: price per unit\n\n---\n\n## 1.2 Troubleshooting (common issues)\n\n- “Nothing happens”\n  - Verify the `IngestStates` plugin instance is enabled and running.\n  - Verify the object has the MsgHub custom config enabled (Objects → Custom).\n  - Verify the “Monitoring” rule type is selected and the rule is enabled.\n  - If you use Freshness: make sure the plugin’s “Evaluate interval” is not `0`.\n- “My rule tabs are hidden”\n  - The object might be marked as “managed” by another source. In that case, MsgHub hides manual rules.\n  - Exception: if `managedBy` contains `IngestStates.<instanceId>`, the UI stays visible for editing.\n- “Threshold never triggers”\n  - Ensure the datapoint value is numeric (strings like `\"42\"` are okay; non-numeric strings are ignored).\n- “It triggered once and never went away”\n  - Check “Back to normal” settings. If auto-remove is disabled, you must close manually.\n  - If you configured a reset delay: keep a non-zero evaluate interval so restart-safe closing can run.\n- “I see a lot of ‘close → reopen’ noise”\n  - Add a reset delay (Back to normal) and/or enable cooldown.\n  - Consider hysteresis / minimum duration for Threshold rules.\n- “It reopened, but I did not get a notification”\n  - That is expected during cooldown: the store becomes open again, but notifications can be delayed/suppressed.\n\n---",
